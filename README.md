# Rain World Warp Menu ![GitHub all releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/LeeMoriya/Warp/total?style=for-the-badge)

Warp is a utility mod for Rain World that allows you to teleport the player to any room in the game, most common uses are to help with the creation of Custom Regions or testing in-development mods.

The Warp menu is accessed via the Pause screen. Rooms in your current region are displayed on the right while a list of vanilla and modded regions are displayed on the left. Clicking on a room button will warp the player to that room. Clicking on a region button will change the list of room buttons to that of the selected region so that you can warp to rooms in different regions without the use of gates.

As of version 1.6, Warp now also features 'Map Warping'. This allows you to teleport to different rooms (and exact positions in rooms) by clicking on their preview image in the Dev Tools Map tab. There are also new buttons in the map tab that will warp you to different regions. MapWarp was created by [Henpemaz](https://github.com/henpemaz) and was integrated with their permission.

Warp supports three sorting options for rooms:
- Type: Room, Shelter, Gate, Scavenger Trader, etc.
- Size: The number of screens a room has.
- Subregion: Which subregion the room belongs to.

Room buttons can be colored independently of the current sorting option, for example you can sort rooms by their subregion, but color them by their type.

Warp also features a color customiser so that you can adjust the colors used for showing room types and sizes as well as the colors of different subregions for each region. These colors are saved in your Rain World\UserData\Warp folder.
