# Rain World Warp Menu ![GitHub all releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/LeeMoriya/Warp/total?style=for-the-badge)

Warp is a utility mod for Rain World that allows you to teleport the player to any room in the game, most common uses are to help with the creation of Custom Regions or testing in-development mods.

The Warp menu is accessed via the Pause screen. Rooms in your current region are displayed on the right while a list of vanilla and modded regions are displayed on the left. Clicking on a room button will warp the player to that room. Clicking on a region button will change the list of room buttons to that of the selected region so that you can warp to rooms in different regions without the use of gates.
