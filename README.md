# Rain World Warp Menu

This mod adds an in-game warp menu to the pause screen. Click on room names to warp to them and region names to reset the cycle and spawn in that region.

## Requirements:
You must have either [Extended DevTools](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X9EQbZ__lla36YLKYijvwsshyEwy7QA7/view) (recommended) or regular DevTools active for the warp menu to appear in the pause screen.
